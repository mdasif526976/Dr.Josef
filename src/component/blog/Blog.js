            What is JWT, and how does it work??</summary>
			<p className="px-4 py-6 pt-0 ml-4 -mt-4 text-gray-200">
            <span className='text-2xl underline'>Answer-1:</span> JWT, or JSON Web Token, is an open standard used to share security information between two parties â€” a client and a server.
             Each JWT contains encoded JSON objects, including a set of claims. JWTs are signed using a cryptographic algorithm to ensure that the claims cannot be altered after the token is issued.
       <br></br>
             <span className='text-2xl underline'>Answer-2:</span>JWTs differ from other web tokens in that they contain a set of claims. Claims are used to transmit information between two parties. What these claims are depends on the use case at hand. For example, a claim may assert who issued the token,
              how long it is valid for, or what permissions the client has been granted.

			<p className="px-4 py-6 pt-0 ml-4 -mt-4 text-gray-200">
            <span className='text-2xl underline'>Answer:</span>NodeJS receives multiple client requests and places them into EventQueue. NodeJS is built with the concept of event-driven architecture. NodeJS has its own EventLoop which is an infinite loop that receives requests and processes them.
